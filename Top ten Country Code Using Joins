I approached this query knowing I needed to join the customer table, where the customer_ids were stored, out to the country table, which had the countries stored. 
Using the ERD I created  I was able to determine that it would require linking the customer, address, city and country tables. 
The first step was to make an alias for customer id that shows it as country count which is the end product that we want. 
I then used an INNER JOIN because I was looking to link specific categories within each table to one another. 
After linking through to the country, I then had to order by country count and limit it to ten to get the top 10.

Step 2
SELECT D.country, C.city,
COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id = D.country_id

WHERE D.country IN (SELECT D.country
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY COUNT (A.customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10)

GROUP BY C.city, D.country
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10
